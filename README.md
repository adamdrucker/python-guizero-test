# Working files to test GUI creation in Python

 * 'gui_test.py' is a demo produced from a tutorial (for reference)
 * 'tld.py' is an experiment in making a character select screen reminiscent of a popular RPG...
 * Included are images, that I own no rights to, just to fill in space
 
 ## Goal is to use this previous work for reference in making a new project
